_Usage_
Basic 'laundry list' of materials needed on-hand to maintain CNC macines, especially LulzBot 3D printers. Grease, nichrome wire, screws, springs, bearings, timing belts, and limit switches are especially recommended, as the types commonly needed for 3D printers are often not available in stores. Particularly where metric standards have not been adopted.
